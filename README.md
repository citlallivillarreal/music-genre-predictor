# Predicting song genre from album art
_Citlallic Gutierrez, Carlos Ortiz, Sydney Trieu_

This project aims to predict a song's genre based on its album cover art in order to identify how music artists' aesthetic decisions align with the industry's status quo. Defining and classifying genre is itself a daunting task, but instead of focusing on the audio aspects of genre, we decided to explore the visual. The bulk of this project further divided into two sections: 1) dimensionality reduction and visualization and 2) modeling using convolutional neural networks.
